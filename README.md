# BankApp
Thank you for your attention to my project.

# Usage

This is a banking site where you can do various operations, namely:
1. Make transactions
2. Create maps
3. Top up your account
4. Remove cards

In order to be able to do all these operations, you need to register on the site and confirm your e-mail using the link that the application will send you.

Also, if you have errors with registration, you need to change the connection string to your database. This can be done in the appsetting.json file
